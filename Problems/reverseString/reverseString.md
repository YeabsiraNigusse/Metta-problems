Introduction

Reversing strings (reading them from right to left, rather than from left to right) is a surprisingly common task in programming.

Instructions

Your task is to reverse a given string.

Some examples:

Turn "stressed" into "desserts".
Turn "strops" into "sports".
Turn "racecar" into "racecar".
