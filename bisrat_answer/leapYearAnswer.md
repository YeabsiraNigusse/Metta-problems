## Leap Year Function

This code defines a function isLeapYear that determines if a given year is a leap year.

- The function uses nested if statements to check the divisibility rules.
- % is the modulus operator, which gives the remainder of the division.
- The function first checks if the year is divisible by 400.
- If not, it checks if the year is divisible by 100.
- If not, it checks if the year is divisible by 4.
- If none of these conditions are met, the year is not a leap year.
